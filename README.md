## Description  
    
Our motivation in making this application was to have a website where users can store their favorite songs.<br>
You ever have somebody ask you what your favorite songs are, but you mind goes blank? This application solves that..<br>
While making this application we learned a lot about making functional and RESTful websites..<br>
